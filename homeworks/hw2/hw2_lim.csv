Do Not Repeal Net Neutrality," November 22, 2017","Net Neutrality (NN) makes it illegal for ISPs to ""throttle"" your internet content. Throttling allows them to choose how fast, and even if, you can have functional access to certain websites. This paves the way for having different plans for different speeds you can visit websites. Currently you can use the internet at full speed for all websites. With Net Neutrality repealed not only would you pay for the internet service but you would pay for one of their plans to allow faster internet.
In 2016, the public and United States Appeals Court disapproved of an effort to repeal NN. We are aware that repealing NN will only benefit the monopolized internet service providers.  The public overwhelming has its best interests in NN as it protects the consumer, and thus we stand to keep NN in effect.","275,474"

"Yes to regime change in Iran, No to dialog with a pro-terrorism government"," June 19, 2018","President Trump’s administration has taken a sound policy towards the destabilizing policies of the Islamic Republic of Iran in the world.

Over 1.5 Million American jobs in jeopardy upon the change of the EB-5 rule – Must re-define the limitations of the visa," March 15, 2018","EB-5 is the only immigration program taking advantage of the foreign direct investment to create US jobs. Due to the limited availability of the visas, currently there are over 150,000 investors’ families having to wait over 10 years to set their feet on the land of the US. The EB-5 Reform Act under review in congress has not proposed to improve this terrible situation. Instead, it will increase the waiting period to 15-20 years and kill the hope of these families that already helped boost US economy. The passage of the law will cause withdrawals of these investments and jeopardize more than 1.5 million American jobs being created nationwide. 
Solution? Add this: The numerical limitations of the visas shall ONLY apply to principal aliens and not to the spouses or children of such aliens.","122,486"

The United States’ 4 decades of unfair sanctions against ordinary people in Iran have harmed Iranians’ right to life, to self-determination, to development, and children’s right.

"A Petition that Donald J. Trump, President of the United States: Pardon Julian Assange",,"Julian Assange has, in the respected tradition of American journalism obtained and published information that is classified and newsworthy, a practice shared with the Washington Post, New York Times, Wall Street Journal et al. The accuracy of materials published by Wikileaks has ever been in dispute. Assertions by the American Intelligence Services that Julian Assange is the agent of a ‘Hostile Foreign State” or the Russian government is politically suspect and completely unproven and denied by Assange. Assange is a humanitarian journalist providing an invaluable platform for whistleblowers exposing corruption and criminality infesting governments, nullifying democracy and obliterating human rights, around the world. We the undersigned urge President Donald J. Trump, Pardon Julian Assange.",377
RELEASE BLOGGER ME NAM AND OTHER PRISONERS OF CONSCIENCE IN VIETNAM NOW," July 20, 2018","There are more than 100 political prisoners currently being locked up in Vietnam. Blogger Mother Mushroom is one of them. Last year, she was sentenced to 10 years in prison for ‘conducting anti-State propaganda’. The State Department thereafter ‘calls on Vietnam to release Mother Mushroom and all other prisoners of conscience immediately’. 
To date, she has not yet been released. Worse, she has been subjected to inhumane treatment which has prompted her to go on a hunger strike. We, therefore, call on the White House and Congress to do all they can to win her release.
Further, we urge this Administration to apply the Magnitsky sanctions against Vietnamese officials who have committed human rights violations in the imprisonment of other political prisoners.",364

"Please keep ""Rule 336"" of the FAA Modernization act INTACT so it will protect model aviation hobbyists."," August 09, 2018","The FAA, Department of Defense, and certain members of congress are looking to remove a current section of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act that directly protects model aviation hobbyists.  This protection called ""Rule 336"" exempts those involved in model aviation for ""hobby & recreation"" from serious & unnecessary regulation from the FAA.  The FAA & officials claim they must do something about ""drones/multi-rotor copters"".  However, there are hundreds of thousands of safe, CBO rule abiding,  fixed-wing R/C pilots being included.  If Rule 336 is modified or removed, our hobby will be dealt a heavy blow - hobby shops will close, club memberships will drop, flying fields will disappear, and young pilots will be discouraged from the great fun of building and flying models.",290
Repeal of the Real ID Act," July 23, 2018","This petition is to repeal the Real ID Act, Pub.L. 109-13, 119 Stat. 302, enacted May 11, 2005. This act initiates a deeper level of monitoring beginning with tracking what federal buildings law-abiding citizens are entering. The Federal Driver License has the potential to be used in a much broader scope then intended. The first area of overreach predicted is in the area of travel. It would begin the tracking of all movements for citizens like an internal passport system. The second concern is the increase of federal data on all citizens putting additional data in federal databases. Benjamin Franklin said that ""those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety."" This law gives up essential liberty for no additional safety.",263
"To declare the Nicaraguan FSLN, National Sandinista Liberation Front, a terrorist organization."," July 21, 2018","The FSLN throughout its existence has shifted from an anti corruption movement, to an extremely corrupt, communist, drug trafficking enterprise that has subjected the people of Nicaragua with extreme violence and mass murder.  It has also sent hit men to end the lives of American Citizens in the US, including members of Congress, who speak out against it.  It has in the past carried out murders in American soil.  The FSLN should no longer be considered a political party, it has given terror to the people of Nicaragua and has sent terror to our beloved United States of America.  We also ask that all visas for active members of the FSLN be revoked and that all immigration statuses of any supporters of this terror organization in the US be revised, green cards revoked for treason.",258

Stop Trump's Military Parade!," July 20, 2018","Why is this Administration wasting taxpayer dollars on a military parade designed to feed the ego of the President when:
Puerto Rico still doesn't have power!
Flint still doesn't have clean water!
We have homeless veterans!
They are cutting funding to CHIP & Medicaid!
They are stealing from Social Security and our future!
And we certainly can't forget all the golf trips and future trips to Trump's properties! Trump benefits from those trips not once but twice! The Trump properties are making money off the cost of his security detail and whomever else he chooses to bring with him! He's double dipping!

Petition to Changes Made to NOAA’s OPC's Graphical Products," August 01, 2018","We/I the undersigned, offer our name(s)/signature(s) to strongly oppose the changes made by NOAA’s Ocean Prediction Center’s synoptic scale meteorological and oceanographic charts that they imposed on the maritime industry. These alterations of removing critically important information that were originally stakeholder driven and in place for decades, now unnecessarily jeopardizes mariners’ safety. We/I further believe that these unwarranted changes put mariners at risk for misinterpretation of the true meteorological and oceanographic picture, especially those mariners engaged in commerce. NOAA's OPC implemented the downgrading of certain products without proper vetting and seeking out consensus solutions, thus not giving the mariner a voice.",196

Help preserve the 10th-century Christian baptism location of Kyivan-Rus in Ukraine!," August 01, 2018","In Ukraine’s capital of Kyiv, archaeologists have found an ancient river port on the Pochaina River, where 1,030 years ago, Prince Vladimir the Great adopted the Christian faith for his people. From here, Christianity spread to all Slavic lands, and led to the history of many countries of Europe and Asia changing. This historical find is sacred to all Christians of the world. Thanks to Ukraine’s Parliament, a resolution was adopted on granting the spot national status and for the creation of a museum in its place. However, due to the unstable political situation, the Donbas War and internal corruption in Ukraine, the find of the century is in danger of being destroyed due to the construction of an underground shopping center. We ask for international support in protecting the holy place.",176
"Reform all existing legislation focused on epinephrine to remove language noting ""auto-injector"" and/or ""EpiPen""."," August 05, 2018","To avoid the appearance of conflicts of interest and to promote open and competitive federal procurement, President Trump should champion reform to all existing legislation that notes the following terms: ""auto-injector"" and/or ""EpiPen"". Rather, the legislation should make use of the terms ""epinephrine"" and specify the doses for the adult and youth applications, .30mg and .15mg, respectively. Thus, government agencies will not be steered to one sole supplier within the procurement process. Specifically, the umbrella legislation essentially steers all agencies and branches to the one vendor and/or a sole alternative to meet the need. Currently, there are many alternatives to the EpiPen, including Symjepi (Adamis/ Sandoz);however, the legislation continues to block agencies from purchasing.",169
